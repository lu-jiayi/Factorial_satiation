2. *Acknowledge the Raise*: If the raise is for work done on a specific project, acknowledge the recognition but express your concerns about the contribution distribution. 

3. *Provide Evidence*: If you believe a colleague did most of the work, provide evidence or specific examples of their contributions and how they should be recognized.

4. *Suggest a Fair Solution*: Propose a fair distribution of the raise or recognition based on actual contributions.

Maintaining professionalism and focusing on fairness can help resolve the issue constructively.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
